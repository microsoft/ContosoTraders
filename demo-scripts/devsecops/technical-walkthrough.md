    b. **contoso-traders-load-testing:** This workflow runs a load testing against the ContosoTraders application using Azure Load Testing.  

      ![image](media/ct5.png)
      
## Monitor GitHub Actions Workflow 

GitHub Actions workflows can be monitored from the Actions tab on a repository. This tab shows a list of all the active and past workflows, along with their status and any associated logs. Users can see at a glance whether their workflows are running successfully and can troubleshoot any issues that may arise. Additionally, users can set up notifications to be alerted when a workflow starts or completes, or if it encounters an error. This can help users stay on top of their workflows and ensure that their projects are running smoothly. 

Let us take a look at the workflows status for Contoso Traders in this public repository.

1. Navigate to [ContosoTraders/Actions](https://github.com/microsoft/ContosoTraders/actions)

## Walkthrough – GitHub Advanced Security  

 
GitHub Advanced Security is a set of features and tools that help users secure their repositories and protect their code. Some of its features include: 


   - Dependency scanning: This feature automatically scans dependencies for known vulnerabilities and alerts users when a vulnerable package is detected. 
   - Code scanning: This feature uses static analysis to detect potential security vulnerabilities in the code itself, and provides alerts and recommendations for how to fix the issues. 
   - Access control: This feature allows users to set up granular permissions and access controls for their repositories, so they can control who can view, push, and manage code. 
   - Secret scanning: This feature automatically scans repositories for potential secrets, such as API keys or password strings, and alerts users if any are detected.
   - DDoS protection: This feature provides additional protection against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, which can disrupt access to repositories and make them unavailable. 

These features can help users secure their repositories and protect their code from a variety of potential threats. 

Let us look at some of the GitHub Advanced Security features in action on your Contoso Traders Public Repo.  

## Enable Dependabot in Contoso Traders 

Dependabot security updates make it easier for you to fix vulnerable dependencies in your repository. If you enable this feature, when a Dependabot alert is raised for a vulnerable dependency in the dependency graph of your repository, Dependabot automatically tries to fix it. 

Let us take a look at how dependabot can be used in Contoso Traders.   

1. Login to your fork of Contoso Traders repository and navigate to Contoso Traders repository `https://github.com/**YOURGITHUBUSERNAME**/ContosoTraders`.
